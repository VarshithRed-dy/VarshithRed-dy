# Hi, I'm Varshith 👋

Final-year Data Science student building **backend systems** and **applied ML** projects.  
I enjoy working on **systems + data**: APIs, pipelines, modeling, and performance-minded code.

---

## 🔭 What I'm working on
- **NLP / Seq2Seq**: Neural Machine Translation experiments (English↔German, English↔Hindi)
- **ML for real systems**: early-warning / retention prediction + dashboards
- **Backend engineering**: FastAPI services, data validation, scalable workflows

---

## 🧰 Tech stack
- **Languages:** Python, C++
- **Backend:** FastAPI, REST APIs, sockets/networking
- **ML:** classification, feature engineering, evaluation, imbalanced learning
- **Tools:** Git, Linux, Docker (learning)
